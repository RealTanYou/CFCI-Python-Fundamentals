# CFCI-Python-Fundamentals
This project and program was created for the Centre for Cyberseucurity Insitutute, Vocational Training Programme, Python Fundamentals Module.

This aim for the project was to demonstrate:

1. General Python knowledge of importing libraries, variable types, functions and classes
2. Sockets, TCP & UDP communication
3. Scanning for alive ports and their respective banners, if possible
4. Argument parsing, error handling, help menu and examples
5. Mutli threading workload to speed up scanning.

This project deliberately minimizes the use existing programs such as nmap or masscan, except for ping, as the aim is to understand how such scanning programs are made for cybersecurity researchers to use.
